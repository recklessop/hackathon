# Challenge #1 - List paired sites with a PowerShell Script

## Overview

This is a very basic script, the idea here is to simply login to Zerto and get a list of the sites that your ZVM is paired with.

Your script will only use one powershell cmdlet, however you should take the time to use variables for the required parameters. Instead of hard coding them, create an area at the top of your script for them.
